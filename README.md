# E-commerce Customer Spending Prediction with Linear Regression 

##  Overview

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to analyze and predict customer spending for an e-commerce clothing store. The business goal is to help the company decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website by quantifying which platform (and which customer behaviors) most directly correlate with high annual revenue.

By processing a dataset of customer profiles—including session lengths, membership duration, and time spent on various platforms—the project demonstrates a full machine learning lifecycle. From initial data exploration and correlation mapping to model training and statistical validation, this analysis provides a data-driven roadmap for optimizing marketing spend and customer retention strategies.
