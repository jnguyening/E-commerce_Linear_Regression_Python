# E-commerce Customer Spending Prediction with Linear Regression 

##  Overview

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to assist an e-commerce clothing company in deciding whether to focus their development efforts on their mobile app or their website. By analyzing customer behavior data—including session lengths, time spent on the app vs. website, and length of membership—this analysis predicts the Yearly Amount Spent by each customer.

The repository demonstrates a complete data science workflow: from initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identifying key revenue drivers, building a predictive model using Scikit-Learn, and performing a deep-dive statistical audit to ensure the model’s reliability. The final insights provide a data-backed recommendation on which digital platform yields the highest return on investment (ROI).
