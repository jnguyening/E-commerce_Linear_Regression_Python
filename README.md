# E-commerce Customer Spending Prediction with Linear Regression (Python)

## Project Overview

This project uses **linear regression** to predict annual customer spending based on behavioral and usage data from an e-commerce platform. The dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website/data), includes features such as session length, time spent on the app and website, length of membership, and more. The goal is to analyze these variables to determine whether the company should focus more on enhancing its **mobile app** or its **website experience**. This project demonstrates how linear regression can be applied to real-world business questions to drive strategic decision-making.
